<section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am graduated in Computer Engineering by Universidade Federal de Goiás. While in graduation, I participated in a research project about Smart Grids, to monitor on real time the electrical consumption of houses. This project started me on the Data field and drove myself to my current path.</p>
    <p>After some professional experiences, I decided to focus myself on the Data and Machine Learning path, since I believe in the impact this field can do to the world. Finishing my Master's Degree on Data Science and available to discuss opportunities to improve your company. Feel free to reach me out!</p>
